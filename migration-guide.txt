* Output Content Type
	- if it has a outputContentType already -> do nothing
	- if it has no outputContentType -> add a outputContentType(MediaType.JPEG)
	- if it has a outputContentTypeSame -> remove that outputContentTypeSame (does not exist anymore)
	if it has multiple outputContentType and/or outputContentTypeSame, the last one did have effect anyway.
